Headless multitrack mixing console in Python

## Installation
```
pip install git+https://github.com/csteinmetz1/pymixconsole
```

## Usage
Setup a mixing `console` with a set of tracks from a multitrack project and apply processing per block.
By default, a `console` will contain n channels and each channel will have a series of default processors:

``` gain -> polarity inverter -> parametric EQ -> compressor -> gain (fader) -> stereo panner ```

These are setup in such a way that if you do not modify their settings the signal should pass largely unprocessed. 
Additionally a `console` is initialized with two effect busses, one for reverb and one for delay. 
Finally there is a master bus which sums the output of all the busses and channels and then applies a simple
processing chain:

``` parametric EQ -> compressor ```

In the example below you can see how to initialize a `console` and then pass multitrack data into the console
and process it block by block to get the output.

## Basic processing

One way to apply processing is to create a multidimensional array of shape [samples, tracks/channels],
where each channel is a mono stream of audio, which will be processed by the associated channel in the console.

In this example we create an array with 8 channels of audio and then instantiate a default console with 8 channels.
Then we iterate over the input data by the `block_size` and we pass each block to the console's `process_block()` 
function, which takes this array, applies each channel processor, and return a stereo mix. We then store this output
in our pre-allocated array. We finally save this data to a `.wav` file with pySoundFile as the end. 

``` python
import numpy as np
import soundfile as sf
import pymixconsole as pymc

data = np.random.rand(44100,8)   # one second of audio for 8 mono tracks
rate = 44100                     # 44.1 kHz sampling rate
block_size = 512                 # processor block size

# create a mix console with settings that match our audio data
console = pymc.Console(block_size=block_size, sample_rate=rate, num_channels=8)

# array to hold the output of the console (stereo)
out = np.empty(shape=(data.shape[0], 2))

# iterate over each block of data
for i in range(data.shape[0]//block_size):

    start = i * block_size 
    stop  = start + block_size

    out[start:stop,:] = console.process_block(data[start:stop,:])

# save out the processed audio
sf.write("output.wav", out, rate)
```

## Console control

pymixconsole provides a high level of control over how the mix console is set up.
By default, a console will include the supplied number of channels, as well as two
busses (one for reverb, one for delay) and a master bus which features a compressor 
and equalizer. By default each channel is created with a pre-gain, polarity inverter, 
equaliser, compressor, post-gain, and a panner. 

There are three levels of processors for each channel: pre-processors, core-processors, 
and post-processors. The distinction is useful since we want to impose some constraints
on how these processors may be randomized in our `randomize()` method. The simple explanation
is that the order of pre and post processors is never shuffled, while core-processors can be.

The defaults were chosen to be a good starting place for basic processing, but the 
user can customize this completely. For example, we can at any time add an extra processor
to a channel as follows. Here we add a second compressor to the third channel's core-processors 
(zero-indexed), and then change the threshold parameter.

```python
console.channels[2].processors.add(pymc.processors.Compressor(name="second-comp"))
console.channels[2].processor.get("second-comp").parameters.threshold.value = -22.0
```

## Processor API

on a channel, bus, or the master bus.
