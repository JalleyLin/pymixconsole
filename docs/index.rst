pymixconsole
========================================

**pymixconsole** is a python package for implementing
and controlling a multitrack mixing console.
It provides the basic components to construct a
basic console along with an extensible API.

There are many complexities involved in the operation
of a digital audio workstation (DAW),
and while some DAWs allow for programmatic control
(e.g. `REAPER <https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascripthelp.html>`_),
they often present a fairly complicated interface to do so.
The goal of **pymixconsole** is provide a simplified interface with
great control over each part of the console's functionality.

For a quick introduction to how to use **pymixconsole**
to begin mixing your multitracks see the :doc:`tutorial`.
